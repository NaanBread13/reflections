When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

This would be important when working in a team so that everyone has access to the latest files
on the repository and can make changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to experiment with only one/a few changes that are in the remote repository with your local version
and decide whether they're worth using

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches can be used for testing out a experimental feature
before putting it in the master branch. Cloning is when you
want to have the respository on github in your own computer.
Forks are used when you want your own version of someone
else's repository and want to make changes without affecting
their own version of the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So if something goes wrong with the latest version of the remote, you can be assured that
there is a working version with the local copy.
