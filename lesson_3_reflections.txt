When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

This would be important when working in a team so that everyone has access to the latest files
on the repository and can make changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to experiment with only one/a few changes that are in the remote repository with your local version
and decide whether they're worth using
