What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialise a repository, a 
.git file is made and the repository is empty. We need a 
respository to able to track changes to multiples files in
a repository and have different versions of a file.

How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is essentially the cart before you go to the
checkout on a shopping store. It allows you add items to be
committed into a repository however you are able to reset files
you don't want to be committed/tracked. It is valuable because
sometimes you might accidentally add a file you don't want and 
will need to remove it.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area shows what files are tracked and what aren't. You can also use git diff, git diff --staged and git diff <commit 1> <commit 2> to compare changes you've made in a file(s) before you actually make new commit.
